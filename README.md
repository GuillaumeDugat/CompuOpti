## :file_folder: Structure of the repository

The repository is made up with three jupyter notebooks, `plannings_modeling.ipynb`, `surface_plot.ipynb` and `preference_model.ipynb`, that enable to show visually our results and understand our work, a folder `src` that contains the code, a folder `instances` that constains examples of instances and a folder `results` to store raw results of computations.


## :hammer: Installation

To install the project, you need to install gurobi optimizer and some basic python libraries that can be installed easily using pip.


## :ferris_wheel: Usage

The notebooks have been designed to be used easily. You can modify the instance name at the begining and run them on different instances.
